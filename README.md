### Introduction:
Pre-trained language models have been recently shown to benefit task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems. Despite their success, existing methods often formulate this task as a cascaded generation problem which can lead to error accumulation across different sub-tasks and greater data annotation overhead. In this study, we present PPTOD, a unified model that seamlessly supports both task-oriented dialogue understanding and response generation in a plug-and-play fashion. In addition, we introduce a new dialogue multi-task pre-training strategy that allows the model to learn the primary TOD task completion skills from heterogeneous dialog corpora. We extensively test our model on three benchmark TOD tasks, including end-to-end dialogue modelling, dialogue state tracking, and intent classification. Results show that PPTOD creates new state-of-the-art on all evaluated tasks in both full training and low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, comparisons against previous SOTA methods show that the responses generated by PPTOD are more factually correct and semantically coherent as judged by human annotators.

### Main Results:
The following table shows our models performances on end-to-end dialogue modelling (Inform, Success, BLEU, and Combined Score) on MultiWOZ 2.0. It also shows the dialogue state tracking (DST) results on MultiWOZ 2.0 and intent classification accuracy on Banking77.

## Example Usage:
In the following, we provide an example of how to use PPTOD to address different TOD tasks **without fine-tuning on any downstream task!** We assume you have downloaded the pptod-small checkpoint and have it in the "./checkpoints/small/" directory (you can find instructions below).
```python
# load the pre-trained PPTOD-small
import torch
from transformers import T5Tokenizer
model_path = r'./checkpoints/small/'
tokenizer = T5Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
from E2E_TOD.modelling.T5Model import T5Gen_Model
from E2E_TOD.ontology import sos_eos_tokens
special_tokens = sos_eos_tokens
model = T5Gen_Model(model_path, tokenizer, special_tokens, dropout=0.0, 
        add_special_decoder_token=True, is_training=False)
model.eval()
```
```python
# prepare some pre-defined tokens and task-specific prompts
sos_context_token_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(['<sos_context>'])[0]
eos_context_token_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(['<eos_context>'])[0]
pad_token_id, sos_b_token_id, eos_b_token_id, sos_a_token_id, eos_a_token_id, \
sos_r_token_id, eos_r_token_id, sos_ic_token_id, eos_ic_token_id = \
tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(['<_PAD_>', '<sos_b>', 
'<eos_b>', '<sos_a>', '<eos_a>', '<sos_r>','<eos_r>', '<sos_d>', '<eos_d>'])
bs_prefix_text = 'translate dialogue to belief state:'
bs_prefix_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenizer.tokenize(bs_prefix_text))
da_prefix_text = 'translate dialogue to dialogue action:'
da_prefix_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenizer.tokenize(da_prefix_text))
nlg_prefix_text = 'translate dialogue to system response:'
nlg_prefix_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenizer.tokenize(nlg_prefix_text))
ic_prefix_text = 'translate dialogue to user intent:'
ic_prefix_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenizer.tokenize(ic_prefix_text))
```
```python
# an example dialogue context
dialogue_context = "<sos_u> can i reserve a five star place for thursday night at 3:30 for 2 people <eos_u> <sos_r> i'm happy to assist you! what city are you dining in? <eos_r> <sos_u> seattle please. <eos_u>"
context_id = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokenizer.tokenize(dialogue_context))
```
```python
# predict belief state 
input_id = bs_prefix_id + [sos_context_token_id] + context_id + [eos_context_token_id]
input_id = torch.LongTensor(input_id).view(1, -1)
x = model.model.generate(input_ids = input_id, decoder_start_token_id = sos_b_token_id,
            pad_token_id = pad_token_id, eos_token_id = eos_b_token_id, max_length = 128)
print (model.tokenized_decode(x[0]))
# the predicted result is
# <sos_b> [restaurant] rating five star date thursday night start time 3:30 number of people 2 city seattle <eos_b>
```
```python
# predict dialogue act
input_id = da_prefix_id + [sos_context_token_id] + context_id + [eos_context_token_id]
input_id = torch.LongTensor(input_id).view(1, -1)
x = model.model.generate(input_ids = input_id, decoder_start_token_id = sos_a_token_id,
            pad_token_id = pad_token_id, eos_token_id = eos_a_token_id, max_length = 128)
print (model.tokenized_decode(x[0]))
# the predicted result is
# <sos_a> [restaurant] [inform] restaurant name rating [multiple_choice] restaurant name <eos_a>
```
```python
# predict system response
input_id = nlg_prefix_id + [sos_context_token_id] + context_id + [eos_context_token_id]
input_id = torch.LongTensor(input_id).view(1, -1)
x = model.model.generate(input_ids = input_id, decoder_start_token_id = sos_r_token_id,
            pad_token_id = pad_token_id, eos_token_id = eos_r_token_id, max_length = 128)
print (model.tokenized_decode(x[0]))
# the predicted result is 
# <sos_r> ok, let me find some options for you. <eos_r>
```
```python
# predict user intent
input_id = ic_prefix_id + [sos_context_token_id] + context_id + [eos_context_token_id]
input_id = torch.LongTensor(input_id).view(1, -1)
x = model.model.generate(input_ids = input_id, decoder_start_token_id = sos_ic_token_id,
            pad_token_id = pad_token_id, eos_token_id = eos_ic_token_id, max_length = 128)
print (model.tokenized_decode(x[0]))
# the predicted result is 
# <sos_d> [book_restaurant] <eos_d>
```
